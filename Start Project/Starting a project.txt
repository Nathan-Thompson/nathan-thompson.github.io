# Starting a New Project

Usually  don't really need to make a whole virtualenv, but it's a good idea to update packages and save the dependencies at the beginning.

pip freeze --local | grep -v '^\-e' | cut -d = -f 1  | xargs pip install -U
pip freeze > project_requirements.txt
Stash requirements as documentation. 

New project template with imports & functions.
