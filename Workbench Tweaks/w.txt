Terminal customization

I've been using the 'novel theme.' To set a theme hit  âŒ˜, and change the theme selected under 'On startup open' on the General tab.


open .bash_profile

alias update='git pull upstream master'
alias jp='jupyter notebook'

alias svr='python -m SimpleHTTPServer'

# current project folder
alias proj='cd ~/desktop/PROJECT_FOLDER

jupyter customization 

#Run this in a notebook cell
import IPython.html 
print IPython.html.DEFAULT_STATIC_FILES_PATH

Mine was:
/Users/username/.virtualenvs/project_name/lib/python2.7/site-packages/notebook/static

Start a New Project

Usually you don't really need to make a whole virtualenv, but it's a good idea to update packages and save the dependencies at the beginning.

pip freeze --local | grep -v '^\-e' | cut -d = -f 1  | xargs pip install -U
pip freeze > project_requirements.txt
Stash this requirements as documentation. 

New project template with imports & functions.
